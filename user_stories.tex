\textbf{As a} user, \textbf{I want} (R1) to place the robot at the beginning point, and make it start running to a prefixed area. When the robot reaches the area in front of a sonar, \textbf{I want} that (R2) the robot stops, turns left about 90$^\circ$, starts blinking a led, takes the photo of the wall in front of it, sends the photo to the console, turns right about 90$^\circ$ to compensate the previous rotation, stops blinking the led and continues its movement to the prefixed area. While the robot is moving \textbf{I want} (R3) to be able to stop it, and make it restart placing it at the beginning point. \textbf{As a} user \textbf{I want} (R4) to see the sonar data on a graphical user interface associated to a console running on a conventional PC. \textbf{As a} user \textbf{I want} that (R5) the system evaluates the expression and plays an alarm sound when its value is less than a prefixed one, and stop the robot. \textbf{As a} user \textbf{I want} that (R6) the robot can stop itself when an obstacle is detected by the sonar in front of it.
