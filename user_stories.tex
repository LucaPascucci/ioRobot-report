\textbf{As a} user, \textbf{I want} (R1) to place the robot at the beginning point, and make it start running to a prefixed area. While the robot is moving and reaches the area in front of a sonar, \textbf{I want} that (R2) the robot stops turn left about 90$^\circ$, start blinking a led, take the photo of the world in front of it, send the photo to the console, turn right about 90$^\circ$ to compensate the previous rotation, stop blinking the led and continues its movement to the prefixed area. While the robot is moving \textbf{I want} (R3) to be able to stop it, and make it restart placing it at the beginning point. \textbf{As a} user \textbf{I want} (R4) to see the sonar data on a graphical user interface associated to a console running on a conventional PC. \textbf{As a} user \textbf{I want} that (R5) the system evaluate the expression and play an alarm sound when its value is less than a prefixed value, stopping the robot. \textbf{As a} user \textbf{I want} that (R6) the robot can stop itself when an obstacle is detected by the sonar in front of it.
