\subsection{Structure}
Distributed systems are composed of a set of active entities (QActor) each working in a (different) computational environemnt (Context). In this case scenario we have three different Contexts, each of which represents a different computational node:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{ctxRadar}: represents the computational node "PC";
	\item \textbf{ctxSensorEmitter}: represents the computational node "Sonar";
	\item \textbf{ctxRobot}: represents the computational node "Robot".
\end{itemize}
