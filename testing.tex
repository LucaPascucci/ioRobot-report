\labelsec{testing}
The system was initially tested using the \textit{robotMock} abstraction locally. The robot mock is totally equivalent to the ddr robot from the point of view of the behaviours, but uses simulated sensory data and generates prints instead of sending electric signals to the pins connected to the motors. The system has successfully passed the testing phase.
