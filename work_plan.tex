\section{Work plan}
\labelsec{wplan}
The point is that we have to specify a model, so we must carefully understand the detail level of the specification.
Our work plan is set as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item find the main subsystems and define the system contexts;
	\item define the structure of the events that can occur in the system;
	\item define the structure of the messages exchanged by the actors;
	\item define the main actors working in each context
	\item define the type of the logical interaction among the actors;
	\item define the logical behaviour of each actor according to interaction constraints.
	\item build and test the new system components (unit testing).
	\item build and test the system (integration testing).
\end{enumerate}
