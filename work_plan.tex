\textbf{DA SISTEMARE PER NOI - COPIATO ED INCOLLATO da BLSLogic}
Our workplan is:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Define a more accurate domain model for input-output devices.
	\item Define the classes involved in the Logic Architecture of the system by taking the Bridge Pattern as a reference point. More precisley:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Define the properties of (a model for) the main system components and compare them with those of the available domain components.
		\item If a system component (model) is different from an available domain component, define the Test Plans for that system components.
		\item Define the Test Plans for the whole System.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Build and test the new system components (unit testing).
	\item Build and test the system (integration testing).
\end{itemize}
