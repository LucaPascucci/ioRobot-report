\subsection{Risk analysis}
The only remarkable risk in this development process is that the platform we will realize will be technology dependent to Java Runtime Environment. The DSL is completely technology independent but the code generation feature will be bounded to the platform’s API written in Java Language. If the deployment environment can’t take advantage of the Java Platform our development process will be slower because we can’t make use of the developed platform.
