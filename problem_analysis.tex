Our technological hypothesis is Java and Object Oriented Programming. We
will show that we need to develop a new infrastructure because the only features
offered by the programming language chosen are not enough. To keep our code
well developed, scalable, efficient and maintainable, we will use the most known
development patterns. We must define an interaction language, that needs a
communication standard.
