\section{Requirement analysis}
\labelsec{ReqAnalysis}
The requirement analysis is an activity done before the development of a software system and the purpose of this analysis is to define the functionalities of the system. This is a basic phase for all software life cycle models, because in this stage the analyst must write all the specifics to describe the whole system. \\
Some definitions:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Robot}: A differential drive robot is a mobile robot whose movement is based on two separately driven wheels placed on either side of the robot body. It can thus change its direction by varying the relative rate of rotation of its wheels and hence does not require an additional steering motion. The robot is equipped with a distance sensor (sonar) and (optionally) with a Web Cam both positioned in its front. It owns also a Led. The robot should move from A to B by travelling along a straight line, at a distance of approximately 40-50 cm from the base-line of the sonars.
	\item \textbf{Sonar}: A distance sensor is a sensor able to detect the presence of nearby objects without any physical contact.
	\item \textbf{Led}: A led is an output device that can show its internal state emitting or not emitting a coloured light (i.e. green or red Led).
