\labelsec{Vision}
A list of notions learned in this course:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A design without specifications cannot be right or wrong, it can only be surprising!
	\item There is non code without a project, no project without problem analysis and no problem without requirements.
	\item The question is how to make them explicit, effective and reusable.
	\item A feature does not exist unless a test validates that it functions.
	\item Analyse a little. Design a little. Code a little. Test what you can.
\end{itemize}
Our vision resumes part of the above-mentioned notions, understand QA language, be able to define a logical architecture and create a model of the system that should be originated from the problem and not from code already available because a software component can be conceived as a logical (abstract) entity that can be implemented in several ways.
