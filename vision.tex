Below a list of values learned in this course:
\begin{itemize}
	\item A design without specifications cannot be right or wrong, it can only be surprising!
	\item There is non code without a project, no project without problem analysis and no problem without requirements.
	\item The question is how to make them explicit, effective and reusable.
	\item A feature does not exist unless a test validates that it functions.
	\item Analyse a little. Design a little. Code a little. Test what you can.
\end{itemize}
